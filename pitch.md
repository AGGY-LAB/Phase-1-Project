## PROJECT PITCH: Monthly Pension Calculation
# Project Name: Monthly Pension Calculation (MPC)

# Overview
MPC is a Web App designed to help individuals save accordingly towards their retirement. MPC helps users set targets towards achieving the financial freedom they desire at their retirement. It helps users first set a target of how much monthly income they intend to have when they retire, and then they are given a monthly amount they will need to save so that when they retire they will have saved enough for them to be able to purchase a pension that gives them their desired monthly income.

# Target Market and Monetazation Strategy

I have identified 10 financial institutions that offer financial advoice to their clients, and specifically pension/retirement financial advice.
I will pitch the Web Application to all of them and sell MPC to them.
I will also pitch MPC to the Retirement Benefits Authority(RBA), which is a government institutions tasked with ensuring that the kenyan workforce is aware of their retirement needs and their rights in that regard.

Alternatively, I may lease MPC the aforementioned financial institutions for a price,thus enusring that for every renewal of the lease, the Premium is re-negotiated based on how active   and attractive MPC was to the clients.
